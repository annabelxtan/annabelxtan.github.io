      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a screen</strong>, I can be found tending to my offspring -- a human and a Sheepadoodle named <a href="http://instagram.com/tintindoodle">Tintin</a>. 
      I read promiscuously but veer towards young adult, sci-fi, and literature, and am a fan of confessional type writing. I also spend a lot of time thinking about food. I used to run a food Instagram called Carb My Enthusiasm.
