     I received my MPH (Epidemiology & Global Health) from the <a href="http://publichealth.yale.edu">Yale School of Public Health</a>, and have an MEng (undergraduate) in Bioengineering from <a href="http://imperial.ac.uk">Imperial College London</a>. 
      I have worked at the <a href="http://ghli.yale.edu">Yale Global Health Leadership Institute</a> as a researcher and program manager.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a screen</strong>, I can be found tending to my offspring -- a human and a Sheepadoodle named <a href="http://instagram.com/tintindoodle">Tintin</a>. 
      I read promiscuously but veer towards young adult, sci-fi, and literature, and am a fan of confessional type writing. I also spend a lot of time thinking about food. I used to run a food Instagram called Carb My Enthusiasm.

    <p><b>P.S.</b> The <b>X</b> in my name stands for <i>Xulin</i>, which is my legal name. My entire family actually has called me Annabel since birth, but never actually put it in legal documents.</p>
