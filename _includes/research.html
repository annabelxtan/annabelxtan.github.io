            I am interested in advancing understanding of how our health is impacted by climate change and social determinants of health using machine learning 
            and causal inference methods. Specifically, I am interested in the health of older adults, an often overlooked population. 
            I work in the lab of <a href="http://michelleodden.com">Michelle Odden</a> at Stanford.
